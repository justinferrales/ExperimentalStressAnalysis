# Overview
In this repository contains a report alongside videos and pictures from an experimental stress analysis class done at Cal Poly. In this class we created a composite using carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). With this we conducted tensile, impact, and fatigue tests. A detailed outline of our procedure and results can be found within the pdf. In the vid folder, IMG_7742 is a slo-mo video of our dogbone specimen under tensile load, IMG_7396 is a video of me using a wet-saw to cut our specimens for imapct testing, and IMG_7740 is a video of the aforementioned specimens being subject to the impact test.
