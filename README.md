# Overview
In this repository contains a report alongside videos and pictures from an experimental stress analysis class done at Cal Poly. In this class we created a composite using carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). With this we conducted tensile, impact, and fatigue tests. A detailed outline of our procedure and results can be found within the pdf.
